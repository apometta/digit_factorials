This small program, written by Andrew H. Pometta, is designed to solve project 
Euler question number 34, digit factorials: https://projecteuler.net/problem=34.

***

145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their
digits.

Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

***

Some mathematical notes: 9! is 362,880.  You will notice that 9! * 8 = 2,903,040.
This is strictly less than 10,000,000, the smallest 8 digit number.  9! * 7 = 
2540610.  This would be the largest possible value we can get with seven 9!s, and 
anything higher than this is known to be impossible to achieve with the digit 
factorial sum.  That is why our max is 2,540,160.  As well, due to the note in the 
problem, we do not include anything below 10.  Thus our range is 10 to 2540610.

See the implementation file for implementation details.  Because of the length of 
the program time, this will take some time, particularly since the language being 
used is Java.  It should be less than one minute, as per typical Project Euler 
specifications.
